# **The Unforgettable U2 Page**

I have created a website surrounding the history and output of the band U2. Since I only had a limited amount of time work on this project, I kept the information to minimum. It will provide an overall history page, a band members page, and a link to the bands discography. This is a site that will expand in scope over time.

## **UX**

### **Project Goals**

The primary goal of The Unforgettable U2 Page is to provide a clear and informative site that can give the user some general background information on the band U2. The intended audience is someone that has none or little knowledge of the band.

#### User goals are:

 * Attain a snapshot of the history and discography of the band U2.
 * Easily navigable pages.
 * Easy to find and intuitive navigation bar.

 #### Developer Goals:

 * A clean looking student project that gives the user a beginning level of knowledge of the band and history.
 * A first project using HTML and CSS.
 * A project that the student can increase in scope and size to use as a portfolio piece down the road.
