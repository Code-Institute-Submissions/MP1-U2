                Bono was born Paul David Hewson on May 10, 1960, in Dublin, Ireland. He was raised in a very spiritual atmosphere, but he came from a mixed marriage: while his father Bob was catholic, his mother Iris was protestant. His mother died when he was only 14 years old. This event, along with the bitter religious conflicts that existed in Ireland had a strong influence on his later songwriting. As a schoolboy, Paul was the class clown of Mount Temple High School. He joined a group of kids known as "The Lypton Village". Everyone in the group got a nickname, and the name that was given to him was "Bono Vox", after a hearing aid sold in a store in Dublin (because he was never calm). Ironically, "Bono Vox" means "good voice" in Latin.

                Dave "The Edge" Evans was born in 1961, in Barking, Essex, in East London, to parents of Welsh descent, Garvin and Gwenda Evans. When he was one year old, he and his family moved to Dublin, where he has lived ever since. Dave Evans was given the nickname "The Edge" by Bono, early in the band's career. Some say it was due to his "edgy" style of playing guitar, while others say it was inspired by the sharp features of his face and his sharp mind. Dave grew up as a quiet kid and was a bit of a loner. He was very intelligent and before U2 was formed, he wanted to go to the university and become a doctor. The Edge took piano and guitar lessons and often performed with his brother Dick Evans. In the fall of 1976, Larry Mullen posted an ad seeking musicians to form a rock band. Dave was the first to respond to the ad, and he went to Larry's house with his brother. The two brothers became part of the band, although Dick soon left the group.

                Adam Clayton was born in Oxfordshire, English on March 13th, 1960, the eldest child of Brian and Jo Clayton. He spent most of his early childhood years in Kenya, but when he was five-year old, the family moved to Malahide Ireland, near Dublin, where his two siblings, Sarah and Sebastian were born. Clayton's parents sent him to St. Columba's boarding school. Having a rebellious character, Adam hated the school and the discipline it required. At 16, he began attending the progressive school Mount Temple Compreshensive, Ireland's first non-denominational school. Being a bit of a hippie, he felt much more free to be himself at his new school, where he met Bono, The Edge and Larry Mullen. Adam was first part of the Max Quad Band before joining Feedback, which later became U2.

                Lawrence Mullen was born in 1961 in Artane, which is located in the north side of Dublin. He had a tragic childhood, losing both his little sister Mary (1973) and his mother Maureen (1977). Larry's love for music first started at the age of 8 when he started learning the piano. He switched to drumming however in 1971 and took classes with Ireland's best-known drummer, Joe Bonnie. In the mid-70s Larry began his signature military-drumming style and became a member of the Artane Boys' Band, a military-style fife and drum band. The marching military sound made him develop a drumming style that to this day is characteristic for the music of U2. In the fall of 1976, he placed a notice at the Mount Temple Comprehensive School looking for people to form a band. Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry met in Mullen's kitchen and formed U2. Larry was the only one who could really play an instrument at the time. As U2 became increasingly popular, Larry added the "Junior" suffix to his name, to avoid being confused with his father.
